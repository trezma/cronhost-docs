# Cronhost REST API

The Cronhost REST API allows you to programmatically manage scheduled HTTP requests using familiar cron syntax. Build integrations, automate workflows, and manage your schedules through a simple, RESTful interface.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://cronho.st/api/v1
```

## What You Can Do

With the Cronhost API, you can:

- **Create schedules** to automatically execute HTTP requests on a cron schedule
- **Manage schedules** with full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- **Control execution** by enabling, disabling, or manually triggering schedules
- **Monitor jobs** to track execution history, success rates, and error details
- **Query job history** with filtering and pagination

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of creating a schedule that checks an API's health every hour:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://cronho.st/api/v1/schedules" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hourly Health Check",
    "description": "Check API health every hour",
    "cronExpression": "0 * * * *",
    "timezone": "UTC",
    "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "timeoutSeconds": 30
  }'
```

## Interactive Documentation

This documentation is built from our OpenAPI specification and includes:

- **Live examples** you can test directly in the browser
- **Complete request/response schemas** with validation
- **Multiple example scenarios** for each endpoint
- **Error response examples** to help with debugging

## Core Concepts

### Schedules
A schedule defines **when** and **how** to make HTTP requests. Each schedule includes:
- **Cron expression** for timing (e.g., `0 9 * * *` for daily at 9 AM)
- **HTTP details** like method, endpoint, headers, and body
- **Retry logic** with configurable attempts and timeouts
- **Timezone support** for accurate scheduling

### Jobs
A job represents a **single execution** of a schedule. Jobs track:
- **Execution status** (PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED)
- **HTTP response details** including status codes and response bodies
- **Timing information** like start time, completion time, and duration
- **Error details** for failed executions

## Getting Started

1. **Get your API key** from the [Cronhost dashboard](https://cronho.st/settings)
2. **Review authentication** in the next section
3. **Explore the endpoints** using the interactive documentation below
4. **Try the examples** directly in your browser or with curl

## Rate Limits

The API has the following rate limits:
- **100 requests per minute** per API key
- **1000 requests per hour** per API key

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your rate limit ceiling
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests left in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: UTC timestamp when the rate limit resets
