# Welcome to cronhost

cronhost is a powerful service for scheduling HTTP requests using familiar cron syntax. Whether you need to trigger webhooks, monitor APIs, send notifications, or automate workflows, cronhost makes it simple and reliable.

## What is cronhost?

cronhost allows you to:

- **Schedule HTTP requests** using standard cron expressions
- **Monitor API health** with automatic retries and timeout handling
- **Trigger webhooks** on precise schedules across any timezone
- **Automate workflows** by calling your APIs at exactly the right time
- **Track execution history** with detailed job logs and error reporting

## Quick Example

Create a schedule that checks your API health every 5 minutes:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://cronho.st/api/v1/schedules" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "API Health Monitor",
    "cronExpression": "*/5 * * * *",
    "timezone": "UTC",
    "endpoint": "https://your-api.com/health",
    "httpMethod": "GET"
  }'
```
